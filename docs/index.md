![MechKit](images/mechkit.svg){ align=left }
The MechKit is a toolkit to build services (AI Mechs) based on the [Gnosis chain](https://www.gnosis.io/) which enable users to post *AI tasks requests* on-chain and get their result delivered back efficiently. An AI Mech will execute these tasks for the user. All the user requires is to pay a xDAI fee to reward the worker service executing the task. AI Mechs are **hassle-free**, **crypto-native**, and **infinitely composable**.

2. Make the necessary adjustments to tailor the service to your needs. This could include:
    * Adjust configuration parameters (e.g., in the `service.yaml` file).
    * Expand the service finite-state machine with your custom states.
3. Run your service as detailed above.
